# C-adventure-game
*   I wrote this program because I was curious about C and I wanted *   to try it out and It was written mostly by trading sleep for coding. *   I am certain that there is tons of ways this code could be better and *   if I have the time and continue to go down the path of C I might come *   back to it.
